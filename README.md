## Dataset
Dataset link: [Download](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xjh19972/boson-nighttime/tree/main/satellite-thermal-dataset-v1)

The ``dataset`` folder should be created in the root folder with the following structure

```
satellite-thermal-geo-localization/datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping_135/
├── test_database.h5
├── test_queries.h5
├── train_database.h5
├── train_queries.h5
├── extended_database.h5
├── extended_queries.h5 # Need to generate by yourself using trained TGM
├── val_database.h5
└── val_queries.h5
```

Check your md5sum after downloading the dataset:

```

## Conda Environment Setup
Our repository requires a conda environment. Relevant packages are listed in ``env.yml``. Run the following command to setup the conda environment.
```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

## Training
You can find the training scripts and evaluation scripts in ``scripts`` folder. The scripts is for slurm system to submit sbatch job. If you want to run bash command, change the suffix from ``sbatch`` to ``sh`` and run with bash.

### TGM training

1. To train Thermal Generate Module (TGM), use one of the following scripts:
```
./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_100.sbatch # Best choice
./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_10.sbatch
./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_100_noncontrast.sbatch
./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_10_noncontrast.sbatch
```

After training TGM, find your model folder in ``./logs/default/satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime``  
The ``satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime`` is your **TGM_model_folder_name**.

2. To generate thermal images from extended_database.h5, run one of the following scripts:

```
./eval_satellite_translation.sh   TGM_model_folder_name # Best choice
./eval_satellite_translation_nocontrast.sh   TGM_model_folder_name
```

After running this scripts, you can find a file **train_queries.h5** in ``./test/default/model_folder_name/satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime``  
Rename it to **extended_queries.h5** and move it to ``./datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping135``.

3. Rename the dataset folder to one of the following:

```
./datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping_135/                  #./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_10.sbatch
./datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping_135_100/              #./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_100.sbatch
./datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping_135_nocontrast/       #./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_10_nocontrast.sbatch
./datasets/satellite_0_thermalmapping_135_100_nocontrast/    #./scripts/train_bing_thermal_translation_100_nocontrast.sbatch
```

The dataset name depends on the training script you use, which is listed on the right of each dataset name. This is to avoid confusion about which TGM setting is used to generate.

### SGM training

To train Satellite-thermal Geo-localization Module (SGM), use one of the scripts in ``./scripts`` per name, for example:

```
./scripts/train_bing_thermal_partial_conv4096_bn_lr_wd_DANN_after_ld_dp_contrast_extended_100.sbatch # Best choice
```

After training SGM, find your model folder in ``./logs/default/satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime-uuid``  
The ``satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime-uuid`` is your **SGM_model_folder_name**.

## Evaluation
To evaluate SGM, use one of the following scripts:
```
./scripts/eval.sbatch   SGM_model_folder_name   backbone_name
./scripts/eval_nocontrast.sbatch   SGM_model_folder_name   backbone_name
```
Note that running evaluation scripts requires two arguments: **SGM_model_folder_name** and **backbone_name**. The typical backbone we use is **resnet18conv4**.

Find the test results in in ``./test/default/model_folder_name/satellite_0_thermalmapping135-datetime``. There will be two folders. This first reports **R@1** and **R@5**. The second reports **R_512@1**, **R_512@5** and **L^512_2**.
